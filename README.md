# Image-correction-code-for-clear-liquids
undistorting the grid after passing through clear liquid, this code is used to identify the shape and height of the droplets
the code does not function yet to correct large amounts of distortion or to plaot the corrections made in order to achieve a map of the liquid; these have yet to be accomplished
